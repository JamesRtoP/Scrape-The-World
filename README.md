# Scrape the world

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND
I'd never touched python or html before this

This is my first webscraping project
This is also my first project using either python or html
Because of this please disregard the excessive comments, I've found it is the easiest way for me to learn during projects

Resources I've used
    Kyan Pepper- introduced me to everything listed below
        Flask
        Flask-SQLAlchemy
        python-dotenv
        flask_cors
        requests
        bs4
        I've had to learn the details of all these by myself, but without Kyan I might never have known about their existence
        He also helped me set up my first flask and npm site
    Flask Quickstart guide -- started me down the python and html site-- https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/
    Python Beginners guide -- helped with what Flask seemed to brush over, I only found it because I was very confused on templates -- https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flask3.html
    Geeksforgeeks Introduction to HTML CSS guide --  filled in most of the gaps that the Python Beginners guide and Flask Quickstart guide left in my html learning path -- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-html-css-learn-to-design-your-first-website-in-just-1-week/?ref=previous_article
    I also used W3schools.com for alternate definition of html items

What have I learned, or begun learning
    Flask: Good idea of the basics
    Python: very brief understanding
    HTML: Feel like I know most of the basics
    CSS: Confident
